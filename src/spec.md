# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the admin panel's image management system with drag-and-drop upload, reordering capabilities, and comprehensive image replacement functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Add drag-and-drop file upload zones throughout the admin panel for direct image uploads
- Implement drag-to-reorder functionality for image lists and galleries
- Add a numbered order system allowing direct position number editing for precise image ordering
- Enable re-upload/replacement for all existing images including offer images, product category banners, homepage banners, lookbook images, product images, and site logo
- Maintain existing click-to-upload functionality alongside new drag-and-drop features

**User-visible outcome:** Administrators can drag files directly into upload zones, reorder images by dragging them or editing position numbers, and replace any existing image or placeholder throughout the site with an improved upload interface.
