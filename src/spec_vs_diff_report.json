  "summary": "The diff adds shared Select sentinel utilities to avoid empty-string SelectItem values and updates both ProductCatalog and AdminProducts to sanitize category options and use sentinel conversions, addressing the Shadcn Select runtime crash risk. Based on the provided (truncated) evidence, no explicit requested requirements are clearly missing, and no clearly unrequested features are evidenced in the actual modified/added file list.",
