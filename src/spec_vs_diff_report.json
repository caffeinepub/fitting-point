      "reason": "The diff summary shows adding a migration and importing it, but does not show any changes to authenticateAdminWithEmailPassword, isCallerAdmin, trimming/case-insensitive comparison, trap messages, or removal of any bootstrap/unlock dependency. The backend/main.mo content shown is largely unrelated type/state definitions and is truncated before any authentication functions.",
